        <h2>Briefing</h2>
        <p>Lasagne are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square portions. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>¼ cup margarine</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps :</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.</li>
            <li>Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.</li>
            <li>Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
